# Kny-Flores Family Arcade

A small family game console that lives on GitHub Pages — five games plus a
score logger, installable as an offline PWA:

- **Magic Coins** — fly the sky or swim the sea (1–3 players), pick your
  character, and race to 20 rainbow coins. Grab power-ups on the way!
- **Rainbow Racer** — drive your unicorn around a sunny 3D arena (1–2
  players) and scoop up 20 rainbow coins as fast as you can.
- **Ship Battle** — a two-player, cross-device naval guessing game (a
  Battleship-style game; "Battleship" is a trademark of Hasbro and is not
  affiliated). Two iPads, one shared code, no server — or play solo against a
  ladder of computer captains. Two full 3D navies: every captain chooses
  **Classic** (Shōkaku, Iowa, Cleveland, a Type VII U-boat, Fletcher) or
  **Modern** (Ford, Kirov, Type 055, Virginia, Hobart).
- **Chess** — full-rules chess with three worlds (the War Room, the unicorn
  Cloud Kingdom, and a starship Galaxy), playable flat or on a 3D board where
  you drag the pieces themselves. Pass-and-play or online over a shared code,
  plus a free-play sandbox for inventing positions.
- **Risk** — world conquest for 2–6 players on one shared board (hot-seat)
  across a real-geography world map, with seatable computer generals from
  gentle to fierce.
- **Yahtzee Logger** — a mobile-first score logger (roll real dice, tap to
  log). One self-contained HTML file, works fully offline.

**Play it:** https://arcade.knyflores.com/

It's free and open source — the whole thing lives in this repo. Want to add a
game? `npm run new-game` puts a starter on the wall;
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the rest.

## Ship Battle

Two people on two different devices play a turn-based naval guessing game
connected only by a short game code — or one person takes on the computer.

- **Peer-to-peer** over WebRTC (via [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)). One player
  taps **Create a game** and gets a 4-character code (and a shareable invite
  link with a QR code); the other taps **Join** and types it in. Game data then
  flows device-to-device.
- **Computer captains** — a solo ladder of opponents from pushover to
  merciless, each a deterministic hunt/target policy (no AI service, works
  offline like everything else).
- **Pick your fleet, then pick your navy** — a cosmetic colour skin (free ones
  plus premium skins unlocked with points), and a separate **Classic / Modern**
  choice of which real navy sails for you in 3D. Every captain picks their
  own, so 1942 can battle 2030.
- **A real 3D ocean** — your fleet rides the swell as authored, optimised
  models with your fleet colour on every waterline. Hits burn with smoke and
  flame, and a sunk ship founders for real: over thirty seconds it lists,
  slips underwater, and leaves only smoke on the surface.
- **Two battle boards** — a **Radar** view (your shots on the enemy) and a
  **Fleet** view (2D grid or the 3D ocean), side-by-side on a tablet or tabbed
  on a phone. The battle log lives in a one-line strip — tap it for the full
  record.
- **Points & history** — win to earn points (bonus for a decisive victory),
  spend them on cooler fleets. Records and unlocks persist in `localStorage`.
- **Resume anywhere** — the whole game is an event-sourced log persisted on
  each device. Step away, lose signal, or refresh, and reconnecting with the
  same code replays the history and picks up exactly where you left off.
- **Installable PWA** — add it to the iPad home screen; everything (including
  both navies' 3D models) is cached, so it opens and plays with no connection.

### How resume / reconnect works

The shared truth is an **append-only log of settled shots**. Everything the UI
shows — whose turn it is, which cells are hit, who won — is a pure function of
that log (plus your own private ship placement). A settled shot is authored
only by the *defender* (the one who can resolve it against their own board),
and turns strictly alternate, so exactly one device writes each log entry.
That single-writer property means two reconnecting peers reconcile trivially:
**the longer log wins**, with no merge conflicts. A dropped message or a
mid-game disconnect self-heals on the next sync.

This is covered end-to-end by a test that simulates a full two-peer game
*including a mid-game outage* and asserts both peers converge on the same
finished game.

## Chess

A full-rules chess game playable two ways and dressed three ways:

- **Same device** — pass-and-play on one screen; the board tells you whose
  move it is.
- **Online** — two devices connected by a 4-character code, exactly like Ship
  Battle (host plays White, guest plays Black). Reconnects and resumes the
  same way.
- **Three worlds** — the classic leather-and-brass **War Room**, the unicorn
  **Cloud Kingdom** on a floating terrace, and the **Galaxy**: rebel ships vs
  the dark side over a starfield, where authored, textured models are joining
  the set piece by piece.
- **A real 3D board** — orbit, pinch, and **drag the pieces themselves** to
  move (taps work too); legal targets light up under a lifted piece.
- **Free play** — a rules-free sandbox with piece trays: build any position by
  drag or tap, then promote it into a real rules-bound game.

Every real rule is enforced: legal move generation, castling, en passant,
promotion (with a piece picker), check, checkmate, stalemate, plus the
fifty-move and insufficient-material draws. The engine is a self-contained,
pure module (`src/games/chess/domain/`) verified by **perft** node-count tests
— the gold standard for a move generator (the opening tree matches 20 / 400 /
8902 at depths 1–3, and the "Kiwipete" position matches 48 / 2039). Online
play reuses the same event-sourced-log design as Ship Battle; the peer
transport (`src/shared/net/peer.ts`) is generic over the message type, so the
games share one WebRTC layer.

## Risk

World conquest for **2–6 players on one shared device** (hot-seat, open
information). Each turn is the classic loop in kid-plain words: **place
armies** (from your territory count plus a bonus for every continent you fully
hold — the income is stamped right on the map) → **attack** (dice, 3 v 2,
defender wins ties, and you choose how many armies march into a conquest) →
**move** (one transfer between connected territories). The last general
standing conquers the world.

- **Computer generals** — seat a bot in any chair, from gentle to fierce; each
  is a seeded, deterministic policy that plays by the same rules you do.
- **Fast openings** — starting armies scale to your share of the map plus a
  small reserve, so the fun starts in minutes, not after a hundred taps.
- **Wild or balanced dice** — pure luck, or dice drawn from a fair bag so
  cruel streaks can't happen.
- **A war-room map you can hold** — parchment, brass, and a colour-washed
  world you pinch-zoom and pan on a tablet; the active general's plaque wears
  their colour. Campaigns autosave and resume from the setup screen.
- **Pluggable, data-driven maps.** The rules engine (`src/games/risk/domain/`)
  is map-agnostic — it only sees an abstract topology (which territories
  exist, their continents/bonuses, and who borders whom). A map is a
  self-contained module under `src/games/risk/maps/` producing that topology
  plus the rendered SVG; nothing in the engine or UI hard-codes "world".
- **Real geography, offline.** The World map is built from real country
  outlines (`world-atlas`, Natural Earth — MIT, bundled) projected to SVG with
  `d3-geo`. No tile server: the whole map ships in the build.

The engine is fully unit-tested (deal, reinforcement + continent bonuses, dice
combat, capture and advance, fortify connectivity, elimination/win), and the
World map has integrity tests (symmetric adjacency, one connected landmass,
every territory in exactly one continent).

## Magic Coins & Rainbow Racer

The little-kid corner of the console, and just as engineered as the rest:

- **Magic Coins** (1–3 players) — pick a character and a world (sky, ocean, or
  rainbow), race to 20 coins, and grab power-ups along the way. Everyone plays
  on one screen at once.
- **Rainbow Racer** (1–2 players) — drive a 3D unicorn around a sunny arena
  scooping coins against the clock.

## Development

Requires **Node 20** (the version CI runs; Node 26's experimental
`localStorage` global currently breaks the jsdom test setup). The repo pins it
machine-readably — `mise` and `nvm`/`fnm` switch automatically via `mise.toml` /
`.nvmrc`, and `package.json`'s `engines` field documents the floor.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm test           # run the test suite (Vitest)
npm run check      # typecheck + ESLint + knip dead-code — what CI gates on
npm run build      # production build → dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build locally
npm run shots      # build, serve, and screenshot every view into docs/screenshots/
npm run new-game   # scaffold a playable starter game (docs/development/adding-a-game.md)
npm run glb        # optimise a 3D model for the bundle (see scripts/optimize-glb.mjs)
```

### Project layout

The app is organised so each game is **self-contained** and the shared platform
is thin. Deleting a game is its folder plus one line in `app/registry.ts`.

```

    risk/                everything Risk
      domain/            map-agnostic rules + bots/ (the generals)
      maps/              pluggable maps: world.ts (real geography via d3-geo) + registry
      components/        RiskBoard, RiskPage, the zoomable map
  app/
    Menu.tsx             registry-driven landing menu
    registry.ts          the ONE list of games
    main.tsx             router built from the registry
    styles/app.css
```

Path aliases (`@shared`, `@games`, `@app`) keep imports independent of nesting
depth. The design principle: **all game rules live in pure, tested modules**;
React and the network layer are thin wiring around them, and the shared platform
never imports a game (only the reverse), so games stay separable.

## Deploy

Deployment is automated by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): every push to `main` builds the app, runs the tests, and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages.

**One-time setup:**

1. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source** and choose **GitHub Actions**.
2. **Custom domain** — the arcade is served at `arcade.knyflores.com`:
   - `public/CNAME` pins the domain (it ships in `dist/`).
   - At the DNS provider for `knyflores.com`, add a `CNAME` record: `arcade` → `rio517.github.io`.
   - In **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**, confirm `arcade.knyflores.com` and enable **Enforce HTTPS** once the certificate is issued.
   - The app is built with a root base path (`/`) for the custom domain. To serve from the bare `github.io` project URL instead, build with `BASE_PATH=/yahtzee-calculator/`.

The Yahtzee logger remains a single vanilla HTML file — served as `calculator.html`, no build required.
